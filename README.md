# InsightViz

A repo for the website hosted at [InsightViz](http://www.insightviz.com). At the moment this website contains a dashboard showing stop and search statistics for UK police forces published by [police.uk](https://data.police.uk/).

This repo contains the next js fontend in the nextjs_frontend folder, aws lambda functions used to connect the dashboard to the backend in the functions folder and scripts used to set up the db in the db-setup folder.
